# No Email, IP and URL for Wordpress Comments

A quite simple plugin to remove Email and Website fields from comments area and to stop collecting the commenter's IP address. Also disables comment system cookie and empties comment notes text. Now including a settings page to selectively disable or enable any of these Wordpress Comments features as needed.
It is also automatically switching the "Comment author must fill out name and email" option in Settings -> Discussion when "Remove Email field" option is switched, because these 2 aren't compatible.
